Description: Analyze seed/root-length experiments from a strict 5-column CSV
    (treatment, concentration, dose unit, root length, length unit). Converts
    length units to centimeters, builds treatment-by-dose groups, and runs
    either Dunnett tests versus a user-defined control (with HC3-robust
    fallback) or Welch ANOVA with Games–Howell all-pairs comparisons. Computes
    relative germination, growth, and Germination Index (% change) versus the
    chosen control, and writes tidy result tables and publication-quality
    plots.
